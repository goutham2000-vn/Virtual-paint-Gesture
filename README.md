# Virtual-paint-Gesture
The Virtual Paint Gesture Project is a computer vision-based application that allows users to draw or paint on the screen using hand movements detected through a webcam, without touching the computer. It utilizes Python along with OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand gestures and track fingertip positions to simulate painting in real-time.
